# Task_2_Data_Storage_Paradigms
The creation of a database using SQL

This was a task done in the course Data Storage Paradigms(IV1351). This task was done togheter with Jens Jonsson, another student at KTH. In this task we used SQL to create a database in accordance to the module in the PhysLog file and make sure the relations, tables and keys were properly created. We also created a histrocial database that would store the most critical information for longer periods of time.

The "insert data script" file is a text document with all the SQL-commands used to insert the data into the database. The PhysLog file is a astah file that can be opened with Astah Professional thta gives a visual representation of the strucutre of the database. The task2Insert file is an SQL source file that includes all the SQL-commands needed to create the database.
